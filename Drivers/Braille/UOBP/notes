callHandler
 - All functions called by callHandler must be aware of the type of information that they are recieving through the void * information parameter.
 All frame handlers will recieve an info pointer pointing to a struct of type FrameInfo
The special frame handler initializeCapabilityNodes must pass some of this info(the pointer to the BrailleDisplay) on to the individual initializers for the individual capabilities.  These initializers take two arguments: a pointer to the capability specific part of the initialization frames initialization buffer, and a pointer to the BrailleDisplay.
